# Copilot Instructions for Konnect Packaging

## Project Overview
- **Konnect Packaging** is a modern web application built with React (Vite) and Tailwind CSS, focused on presenting company information, products, and achievements in a visually engaging way.
- The codebase is organized for clarity, with reusable components under `src/components`, assets in `src/app/assets` and `public/`, and utility logic in `src/lib`.

## Architecture & Patterns
- **Component Structure:**
  - Major UI sections (e.g., Progress, Awards, Blogs, Contact) are implemented as React components in `src/components`.
  - Components are typically functional, use hooks for state/effects, and are styled with Tailwind CSS classes.
  - Example: `Progress.jsx` uses a custom `useInView` hook for scroll-triggered animation and a nested `CircularProgress` component for animated SVG progress.
- **Assets:**
  - Images and static files are stored in `public/` and referenced directly in components.
  - Organized by feature (e.g., `public/VCI/`, `public/eco/`).
- **Styling:**
  - Tailwind CSS is configured via `tailwind.config.js`.
  - Font imports are handled at the component level (see `Progress.jsx`).
- **Utilities:**
  - Shared logic can be placed in `src/lib/util.js` or `src/utils/`.

## Developer Workflows
- **Development:**
  - Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
  - Main entry: `src/main.jsx`, root component: `src/App.jsx`
- **Build:**
  - Production build: `npm run build`
  - Output is generated by Vite.
- **Preview:**
  - Preview production build: `npm run preview`
- **Dependencies:**
  - Managed via `package.json`. Uses Vite, React, Tailwind CSS, and fontsource packages.
- **Deployment:**
  - Vercel configuration in `vercel.json`.

## Project-Specific Conventions
- **Component Naming:**
  - Use PascalCase for React components (e.g., `ProductDetail.jsx`).
- **File Organization:**
  - Group related assets and components by feature or section.
- **Animation & Effects:**
  - Use custom hooks (e.g., `useInView`) for scroll/visibility-based effects.
  - Prefer SVG for animated graphics (see `CircularProgress` in `Progress.jsx`).
- **Fonts:**
  - Import fonts at the component level using `@fontsource`.

## Integration Points
- **No backend/API integration** is present in the current codebase; all data is static or hardcoded in components.
- **External assets** are referenced from the `public/` directory.

## Key Files & Directories
- `src/components/` — Main React components
- `src/app/assets/` and `public/` — Images and static files
- `tailwind.config.js` — Tailwind CSS configuration
- `vite.config.js` — Vite build configuration
- `vercel.json` — Deployment settings for Vercel

## Example: Progress Section
- See `src/components/Landingpage/Progress.jsx` for:
  - Custom animation with hooks
  - SVG-based progress visualization
  - Tailwind-based responsive layout

If you add new features, follow the established component and asset organization. For questions, check similar patterns in `src/components/` or ask for clarification.
